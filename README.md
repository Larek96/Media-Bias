📰 Media Bias Analysis Dashboard

    Exploring media bias in an age of division and polarization.

📌 Overview

In a time where political division is increasingly evident, I—like many others—began to question the reliability and bias of the news I consume. This project is my attempt to dive into media bias across major news outlets and build an interactive dashboard to make bias easier to visualize and understand.

My goal wasn't necessarily to eliminate biased sources, but rather to better balance my media diet by understanding which outlets lean left, right, or center.
📂 Dataset Selection

After evaluating several options, I narrowed it down to two:

    🧠 MBIC (Media Bias Including Characteristics) – Highly detailed, with word-level annotations and annotator profiles.

    📊 AllSides Media Bias Ratings – Simpler, high-level categorization of outlet bias (e.g. Left, Center, Right), ideal for dashboarding.

I ultimately chose AllSides for this project due to its ease of use and digestibility for broader audiences.
🗂️ About the Data

    The AllSides dataset was originally created in 2019.

    Ratings are continuously updated based on community votes and editorial reviews.

    I manually updated several ratings based on recent changes (e.g. Bloomberg and The Guardian as of 2024).

🔧 Data Cleaning

Minimal cleaning was required:

    Removed outlets without a bias rating.

    Standardized wording for bias labels (e.g., “Lean Left” → “Left-leaning” for clarity).

🎯 Key Questions Explored

    Is there more left-leaning or right-leaning bias overall?

    Which outlets are most prominent across the bias spectrum?

    Are certain outlets more credible than others, regardless of their bias?
