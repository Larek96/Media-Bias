# Media-Bias

In a time where political polarity and division is high, I like many others started to question the sources of my information and just how far media bias can go in either direction.

The purpose of this project was to give me the opportunity to analyze the media bias of given outlets, and to either elimate highly biased outlets or balance them with those on the other end of the spectrum.

I ended up deciding between two options; [MBIC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timospinde/mbic-a-media-bias-annotation-dataset) and AllSides. The MBIC dataset has far more information down to specific article and annotater levels, so I decided to go with AllSides for a more high-level and easily digestable dashboard.

The AllSides dataset was created in 2019, and from that point forward has updated their ratings based on community votes. I manually updated any ratings that have been updated in 2019 for major outlets such as Bloomberg and the Guardian.
